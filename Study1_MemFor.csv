In the gathering of forgiveness, one can only look at their own actions and first issue the results as one's own fault first, as heavy a burden as that may be. 

The rectify of the situation is to move into another light of the self, that takes full blame of one's actions & devises, allowing for the beginning of a repair towards one's faltering ego. 

What happens to others is their reaction to a state of occurrences, and not meaning to be pointed directly at you. However, being part of the ""error"" one must attempt to decipher one's own actions that could have provoked the situation of a fail. 

To better oneself is the only answer, and that is not expected to be instant, but rather a patient self that demands recognition of the past, and confidence into the future. 

When abiding by the truth of oneself, there can be many faults found, & letting go of the faults of others is vastly important.
Healing is difficult due to one's own pity of events, 
almost nearly impossible in some situations. 

In conclusion, transfer the blame to oneself and deal with oneself on that level, 
in order to begin locating contentment again.

My husband warned me that she could be very manipulative and to politely decline, but I didn't believe him. She asked for a list of names to invite, which I gave her. A few weeks passed, and a few days before the shower was to take place, we were dropping off the kids at her house. There on the kitchen counter was the stack of unmailed shower invitations. She absolutely knew I would see them sitting there in plain sight. The only people who ended up coming to the shower were her family members and one friend of mine whom I'd invited personally. None of my other friends ever got their invites. I realized then that she had no intention of being a ""happy family"" as she loves to proclaim on social media.
