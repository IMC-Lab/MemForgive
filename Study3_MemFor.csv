I stopped taking those new meds because they gave me severe side effects that mirrored the serotonin syndrome I'd had a few years prior, and I went back on my old meds instead. He also conveniently left out the part where I work full time and pay for a housekeeper so literally the only thing he was ever expected to do was the nightly dishes (that our teenagers mostly did), take the trash out (again, that our teenagers mostly did), and bring his laundry downstairs.

75.107.231.34,"Relevant background: I have lived with PTSD for 29 years as a result of an armed robbery.

Through my work as a cook, I became friendly with one of the other cooks who eventually became my handy-man and helped me work on finishing my cabin. Over the course of our 3 year friendship he had become well aware of my PTSD and my my extreme aversion to guns. He would always ask permission to bring the gun onto my wilderness property (in case of snakes) prior to arriving and always told me, upon arrival exactly where he would keep the gun. In August of 2020 he had come out to do some minimal work and was excited he had found employment after being laid of in March as a result of Covid and was to start the job at the end of the week. Later that evening he called to ask if he could borrow $40 to get him by until he got paid. I told him sure, but he would need to drive out to my property to pick it up (I don't drive at night). He arrived as a backseat passenger in someone else's car. He seemed jittery, anxious and in a hurry. He took the money, gave me a hug and then got back into the backseat and the driver left the property. Two days later a Sheriff's detective appeared on my property to question me about a body that had been found about a mile away from my property. It was then I was told that the driver and my handyman had murdered someone and the body was in the vehicle when they arrived on my property the night my handy-man picked up the money. He not only disrespected everything he knew about me, but it triggered my PTSD for over a year until he was finally sentenced to prison and I then knew he couldn't hurt me.",44044,No,7,1,2,7,1,6,2,2,4,2,2,2.4,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,6.714285714,4,1,1,1,5,4,2.666666667,55,Non binary / Other
